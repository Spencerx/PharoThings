I provide implementation of accelerometer ADXL345.

The code for initialization and sensors reading is copied from sunfolder example:
 
	https://www.sunfounder.com/learn/Super_Kit_V2_for_RaspberryPi/lesson-14-adxl345-super-kit-for-raspberrypi.html
	
The real meaning of retrieved coordinates are explained in this link but not really clean.
So I just repeat their example according to the board model approach
